# Breakout
Opengl Breakout

# Missing GLM in libraries because there are a lot of files, but it's easly fixable 

# Things to do (there's a lot)

The things to improve are a lot, like fixing OpenGL calls(there are DSA functions mixed with non DSA and it's kind of a mess ngl), needs particle effects support and postprocessing effects for cool gameplay footage, also I would love to try to implement an algorithm which uses SDFs for collision resolution, in 3D sounds like a nightmare, but to be honest in 2D seems managable (from my basic understanding at least).

Also text rendering, but it's more of a framework thing so it's not really tied to the breakout development itself

# Things that work

Gameplay (No scorse or lose condition I KNOW)

Collisions (Really rudimentary collision system, it's not really efficent but at least it works)

# Inspiration
Most of the game is inspired by learnopengl.com, but I don't really like copy and pasting, so most of the code you will read it's written from scratch with the 
same concepts in mind.
