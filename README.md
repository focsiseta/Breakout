# Missing GLM in libraries because there are a lot of files, but it's easly fixable 

# Things to do (there are a lot)

The things to improve are a lot, like fixing OpenGL calls(there are DSA functions mixed with non DSA and it's kind of a mess ngl), needs particle effects support and postprocessing effects for cool gameplay footage, also I would love to try to implement an algorithm which uses SDFs for collision resolution, in 3D sounds like a nightmare, but to be honest in 2D seems managable (from my basic understanding at least).
